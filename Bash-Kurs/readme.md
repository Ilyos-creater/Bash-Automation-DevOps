# Bash-Scripting-Notes

This subdirectory contains a collection of Bash scripting projects completed as part of a hands-on learning journey.

Each project focuses on solving a real-world task or challenge using Bash. These scripts demonstrate practical use cases such as automation, file manipulation, system operations, and more.

The goal of this directory is to serve as a reference point for applying Bash scripting in useful and repeatable ways.

> Note: These projects were built progressively while learning, so the complexity and style may vary.
